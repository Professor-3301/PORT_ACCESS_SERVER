        <h1>Key Features of PortAccess</h1>
        <p>
            PortAccess provides a robust, token-based network access control system designed to enhance server security 
            by controlling which users can access your non-web server ports. Our features aim to balance security 
            and ease of use, ensuring only authorized users can interact with your system.

    <!-- Detailed Features Section -->
    <section class="features-details">
        <h2>Our Features</h2>

        <!-- Feature 1: Secure Port Access Control -->
        <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>🔒 Secure Port Access Control</h3>
            <p>
                By default, access to all non-web server ports (excluding ports 80 and 443) is denied. Only authorized 
                pentesters, who have been issued access tokens, can gain access to these ports for security testing.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Feature 2: Token-Based Authorization -->
        <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>🔑 Token-Based Authorization</h3>
            <p>
                Our system issues unique, time-bound access tokens to pentesters. These tokens authorize specific 
                pentesters to access the non-web ports, providing flexibility and accountability for server owners. 
                Tokens can be generated, revoked, and customized for individual pentesters.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Feature 3: Dynamic Firewall Integration -->
        <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>🛡️ Dynamic Firewall Integration</h3>
            <p>
                PortAccess integrates with a client-side firewall application to dynamically allow access to only authorized 
                IP addresses. The firewall updates in real-time based on the presence of valid tokens, ensuring that 
                unauthorized users cannot access restricted ports.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Feature 4: Whitelisting of Pentester IPs -->
        <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>📋 Whitelisting of Pentester IPs</h3>
            <p>
                Pentester IP addresses are added to a whitelist upon token verification. This ensures that only validated 
                pentesters with approved IP addresses can access the non-web ports during the authorized time window.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Feature 5: Easy Access Management -->
        <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>⚙️ Easy Access Management for Server Owners</h3>
            <p>
                Server owners can manage who has access to their ports using an intuitive interface. Owners can easily 
                view a list of authorized pentesters, manage their tokens, and review access logs to monitor activity.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Feature 6: Detailed Logs and Reporting -->
        <div class="feature-item">
            <h3>📊 Detailed Logs and Reporting</h3>
            <p>
                Every access attempt to your server’s ports is logged, including the pentester’s details, IP address, 
                and access time. These logs help server owners track who accessed their server and ensure that no 
                unauthorized activity has occurred.
